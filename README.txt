README - Lunisolar

Lunisolar is an iPad dsigned to provide an intuitive, visual sense of where various world 
holidays fall in relation to the standard gregorian calendar. For the international business 
person or interested chrono-afficianado, this kind of tool is vital. It maps holidays from the 
Hebrew, Roman Catholic, Islamic, and American calendars on to one. Years can be selected, or you can press 
play and watch time pinwheel forwards or back. 

The outermost ring of days are Sundays, the inner most Saturdays. Holidays that occur on 
fixed days with in our solar calendar fall to the center. Other, like Ramadan, occur on 
fixed dates within their own lunar-based calendar. 10 days shorter than the gregorian calendar, 
this causes the holy month to appear to "drift" through the years, earlier and earlier.
